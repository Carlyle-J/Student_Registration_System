## Student Registration System (Java, JDBC, NetBeans)

This project is a simple **Student Registration System** built using **Java Swing (Frames)**, **JDBC**, and **NetBeans IDE**. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations and provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for managing student records.

### Features

* **Add Student**
  Enter student details and save them directly to the database.

* **Delete Student**
  Remove an existing student’s record.

* **Refresh Data**
  Instantly reload and display the latest student information after any operation.

* **Exit Application**
  Close the system using the exit button.

### Technologies Used

* **Java (JDK)**
* **JDBC** for database connectivity
* **MySQL**
* **Java Swing (JFrames)** for GUI
* **NetBeans IDE**

###Purpose of the Project

This project was created to practice **database connectivity**, **GUI development**, and **basic CRUD operations** in Java.

### How It Works

1. The user interacts with a clean, button-based GUI built using Swing.
2. Each action (Add, Delete, Refresh, Exit) triggers JDBC code that communicates with the backend database.
3. Data is updated in real-time and reflected in the interface.
